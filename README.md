# FHNW Big snek quiz (Working title)

This project is intended to:

- Train students on the subjects of the assesments modules through quizzes
- Apply basic **Python** programming concepts learned in the Programming Foundations module
- Practice the complete process from **problem analysis to implementation**
- Demonstrate the use of **console interaction, data validation, and file processing**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code
- Prepare students for **teamwork and documentation** in later modules  
- Developing project planning skills

## 📝 Analysis

**Problem**
> We learn a lot of material in this semester that is crucial to our further education. This can be overwhelming or even frightening. The material is spread over various Moodles / Inside FHNW, which is chaotic.

**Scenario**
> To enhance the learning process we aim to crate a catalouge of questions which will be presented as a quiz to prepare for our assesment exams. The quiz will be asking questions from one subject and split into chapters. The type of questions will be mulitple choice. The Answers will be validated and give an indication of right or wrong and will also show an explanation. At the end of the quiz, the user will be given a score.


**User stories:**
1. As a user, I want to answer different questions, in order to support my studies for the test.
2. As a user, I want a point counter/final grade/percentage presented, in order to check my performance.
3. As an Admin, I want to add and remove questions, in order to keep the quiz relevant.

**Use cases:**
- Answer Questions (from database.json)
- Show Grade / Points / Percentage (to results.csv)

### 3. File Processing


## ⚙️ Implementation
- application architecture

### Technology
- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- No external libraries

### 📂 Repository Structure

### How to Run

### Libraries Used
