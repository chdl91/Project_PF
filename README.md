# FHNW Big snek quiz (Working title)

This project is intended to:

- Train students on the subjects of the assesments modules through quizzes
- Apply basic **Python** programming concepts learned in the Programming Foundations module
- Practice the complete process from **problem analysis to implementation**
- Demonstrate the use of **console interaction, data validation, and file processing**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code
- Prepare students for **teamwork and documentation** in later modules  
- Developing project planning skills

## 📝 Analysis

**Problem**
> We learn a lot of material in this semester that is crucial to our further education. This can be overwhelming or even frightening. The material is spread over various Moodles / Inside FHNW, which is chaotic.

**Scenario**
> To enhance the learning process we aim to crate a catalouge of questions which will be presented as a quiz to prepare for our assesment exams. The quiz will be asking questions from different subjects and in differing grades of diffuculty. Additionaly the type of questions will vary between mulitple choice, True/False and open text. The Answers will be validated and give an indication of right or wrong and will also show an explanation. At the end of the quiz, the user will see their results on a leaderboard with a given score related to it.


**User stories:**
1. As a user, I want to answer different questions to different topics, in order to learn a broad variety of topics.
2. As a user, I want to have my progress and achievements saved, in order to track my achievenments.
3. As a user, I want to create a username, in order to identify myself.
4. As a user, I want a point counter/final grade/percentage presented, in order to check my performance.
5. As a user, I want to see a leaderboard, in order to compare my results to other users.
6. As an Admin, I want to add and remove questions, in order to keep the quiz relevant.
7. As an Admin, I want to modify the userbase and leaderboards, in order to remove redundant data.


**Use cases:**
- Answer Questions (from database.txt)
- Show Nickname (to username.txt)
- Show Leaderboard (to leaderboard.txt)
- Show Grade / Points / Percentage (to results.txt)

## ✅ Project Requirements

Each app must meet the following three criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---

### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:
- Enter a Nickname
- Answer Questions
- See leaderboard
- Receive a grade/point total
- Recieve Points per subject



### 2. Data Validation


### 3. File Processing


## ⚙️ Implementation

### Technology
- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- No external libraries

### 📂 Repository Structure

### How to Run

### Libraries Used
